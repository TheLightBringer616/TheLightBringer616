    I am an applied physicist and I am seeking a career as a Data Analyst or Data Scientist. <br>

    Areas of interest:
    <ul>
        <li>Biomedical Engineering</li>
        <li>Biophysics</li>
        <li>CFD</li>
        <li>Computational Physics</li>
        <li>Data Analysis/Science</li>
    </ul>

    As an applied physicist, I have developed a strong understanding in mathematics and statistics, and a strong ability to solve a wide variety of problems, specially in the area of data analysis and scientific computing. <br>

    I have the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate which can be verified at <a href="https://www.credly.com/users/luis-carlos-olivares-rueda">Credly</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luis-carlos-olivares-rueda-444a44249">Linkedin</a> <br>
