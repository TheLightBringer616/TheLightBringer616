# Luis Olivares (TheLightBringer616)

I am an applied physics student in process of graduating and I am seeking a career as a Data Analyst or Data Scientist.
<br>

As an applied physicist, I have developed a strong understanding in mathematics and statistics, and a strong ability to solve a wide variety of problems.
<br>
<br>

I have the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate which can be verified at <a href="https://www.credly.com/users/luis-carlos-olivares-rueda">Credly</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luis-carlos-olivares-rueda-444a44249">Linkedin</a>. <br>
The Professional Certificate consists of building data science skills, learning Python & SQL, analyzing & visualizing data and building machine learning models.
